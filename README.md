### 1. Sudoku Validator with Custom Zones

**File:** `SudokuValidatorWithCustomZones.java`

Validate a 9×9 Sudoku board using standard rules (rows, columns, 3×3 boxes) plus additional custom zones of 9 cells each.

### 2. Alien Dictionary

**File:** `AlienDictionary.java`

Given a sorted list of alien words, determine the character order using a topological sort over the precedence graph.

### 3. Knights and Portals

**File:** `KnightsAndPortals.java`

Find the shortest path from top-left to bottom-right on a grid of 0s and 1s, moving in four directions and using one teleport between any two empty cells.

### 4. Bitwise Matching Pattern

**File:** `BitwiseMatchingPattern.java`

Given an integer `n`, find the next larger integer with the same number of 1s in its binary form, using bit manipulation techniques.

### 5. Matrix Islands with Diagonals

**File:** `MatrixIslands.java`

Count how many islands of 1s exist in a grid, where connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors.

### 6. Mini Interpreter

**File:** `MiniInterpreter.java`

A simple interpreter supporting `let` declarations and single-line `if` statements, evaluating integer expressions and conditions, and printing final variable states.

**Instructions**:

1. Compile each Java file:

   ```bash
   javac <FileName>.java
   ```
2. Run the compiled class:

   ```bash
   java <ClassName>
